# ⚡ Electricity Consumption Data Analysis

## 🔍 Overview
This exploratory data analysis (EDA) project investigates electricity consumption trends across various sectors. The primary objective is to apply foundational data handling and visualization techniques to derive insights from a real-world dataset and develop strong data literacy skills as part of my AI/ML learning journey.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: Manually uploaded (placeholder for open data or local government data)
- **Filename**: `electricity_consumption.csv`
- **Columns**:
  - `date`: The recorded date
  - `sector`: Type of electricity consumption sector (e.g., total, local, commercial)
  - `consumption_mwh`: Electricity consumed in megawatt-hours (MWh)

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- (Optional) Seaborn

---

## 🧪 Key Activities
- ✅ Loaded and inspected the dataset
- ✅ Checked for missing values
- ✅ Performed descriptive statistics (`.describe()`)
- ✅ Filtered and grouped data by sector
- ✅ Visualized consumption patterns using line/bar charts
- ✅ Summarized key insights in markdown cells

---

## 📈 Sample Visualizations
- Line chart showing total consumption over time
- Sector-wise electricity usage comparison
- Pie chart showing consumption share per sector *(optional)*

---

## 📊 Insights
- **Local Commercial Sector** shows steady growth in electricity usage.
- **Domestic Sector** exhibits seasonal patterns and peaks.
- **Losses and Exports** remained relatively stable across years.
- Data highlights which sectors are most energy-intensive, helpful for forecasting and planning.
